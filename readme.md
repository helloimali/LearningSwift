The plan:

Set up sql databse (local)
make a node js backend and connect to the sql database

front end:
hit "add " button 
fill out info/fields
hit "finish"

When "finish" is hit, information is added to database

when tabe is viewed, pulls data from database.
when something in the table is clicked, more information is given (like in the search app)

Progress:
SQL database is created (PersonalDict)
Table is created (dict)
node.js backend is created and fully connects to the database and table
node.js backend can succesffully edit the database
index.html can now send a post reqest that will add the chars to database
